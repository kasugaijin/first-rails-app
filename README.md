# README

This is my first web application built using Ruby on Rails and is the product of a tutorial from The Odin Project. The purpose of this exercise is to test rails and heroku are installed properly, and to run through the steps of creating a rails application, configuring it for heroku, and deploying to heroku so it is accessible online.
